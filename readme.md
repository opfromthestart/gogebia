show range formula with no condition
show range that uses .S.
show infinite range with a map, with condition of existence, which is that anything other than false or errors evals to true in a condition.
show filter with .F.
Show that range formulas cant intersect.
Show exponential growth with limit, but that can go infinite.
Show amortization table with dynamic number of rows.
show multi file linking, new sheets made will be placed inside folder of name of original file.
